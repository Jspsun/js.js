# React Sandbox
I wanted to spend some time making some random react components that I can later turn into a nice library. This was the template I set up for myself to have a nice blank canvas to write components. I've also set up this repo to output a deployable version of your storybook server in the `/dist/` directory if you `npm run build-storybook`.

# Running storybook
1. `npm run storybook`
2. navigate to http://localhost:6006/

## Some useful articles that will help you bootstrap your first react project:
- [React Router](https://medium.com/@pshrmn/a-simple-react-router-v4-tutorial-7f23ff27adf)
- [Webpack and babel](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/)
- [I've combined the above two guides into an easy to clone project](https://github.com/Jspsun/MinimalReactBoilerPlate)
