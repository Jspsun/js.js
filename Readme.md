# js.js
I wanted to spend some time making some random react components that I can later turn into a nice library. This was the template I set up for myself to have a nice blank canvas to write components. I've also set up this repo to output a deployable version of your storybook server in the `/dist/` directory if you `npm run build-storybook`.



The package is available for installation at `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jspsun/js.js` using `npm install @jspsun/js.js`


You can see all the components in production [here](https://jonathan.solar/)

# Starting up a server for local development
1. `npm run storybook`
2. navigate to http://localhost:6006/
